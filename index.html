<h1>THE LION AND THE MOUSE</h1>
<h2>
<div style="width: 425px; opacity: 0.80; border: 30px solid #fff; text-align: left; background: #fff;"><strong>
<p> A Lion was awakened from sleep by a Mouse running over his face. Rising up in anger, he caught him and was about to kill him, when the Mouse piteously entreated, saying: "If you would only spare my life, I would be sure to repay your kindness."
<br>
<br>The Lion laughed and let him go. It happened shortly after this that the Lion was caught by some hunters, who bound him by strong ropes to the ground.
<br>
<br>The Mouse, recognizing his roar, came up and gnawed the rope with his teeth, and, setting him free, exclaimed: "You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, not expecting to receive from me any repayment of your favor; but now you know that it is possible for even a Mouse to confer benefits on a Lion."

<br>
No one is too weak to do good.

<h3>THE ELEPHANT IN FAVOR</h3>
<h4>
<p> Once upon a time the Elephant stood high in the good graces of the Lion. The forest immediately began to talk of the matter, and, as usual, many guesses were made as to the means by which the Elephant had gained such favor.
<br>
<br>“It is no beauty,” say the beasts to each other, “and it is not amusing; and what habits it has! what manners!”
<br>
<br>“If it had possessed such a bushy tail as mine, I should not have wondered,” says the Fox.
<br>
<br>“Or, sister,” says the Bear, “if it had gotten into favor on account of its claws, no one would have found the matter at all extraordinary; but it has no claws at all, as we all know well.”
<br>
<br>
“Isn’t it its tusks that have gotten it into favor?” thus the Ox broke in upon their conversation. “Haven’t they, perhaps, been mistaken for horns?”
<br>
<br>
Then said the Ass, shaking its ears, “Is it possible that you don’t know how it has succeeded in making itself liked, and in becoming distinguished. Why, I have guessed the reason. If it hadn’t been remarkable for its long ears, it would never in the world have gotten into favor.”
