<h1>THE LION AND THE MOUSE</h1>
<h2>
<div style="width: 425px; opacity: 0.80; border: 30px solid #fff; text-align: left; background: #fff;"><strong>
<p> A Lion was awakened from sleep by a Mouse running over his face. Rising up in anger, he caught him and was about to kill him, when the Mouse piteously entreated, saying: "If you would only spare my life, I would be sure to repay your kindness."
<br>
<br>The Lion laughed and let him go. It happened shortly after this that the Lion was caught by some hunters, who bound him by strong ropes to the ground.
<br>
<br>The Mouse, recognizing his roar, came up and gnawed the rope with his teeth, and, setting him free, exclaimed: "You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, not expecting to receive from me any repayment of your favor; but now you know that it is possible for even a Mouse to confer benefits on a Lion."

<br>
<br>
No one is too weak to do good.
